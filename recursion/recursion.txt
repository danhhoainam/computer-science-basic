Purpose:
  (1) it can simplify code, 
  (2) it can speed up programs by requiring less information to be stored.

Devide and Conquer:
  (1) divide a problem into equal sized sub-problems recursively;
  (2) conquer each problem separately, solving them recursively;
  (3) combine results.

Devide and Conquer is usually used for:
  (1) Strassenâ€™s algorithm for matrix multiplication
  (2) sorting algorithms: Merge sort, quick sort
  (3) calculating a Fourier transform.
  (4) Maximum sub-array problem
