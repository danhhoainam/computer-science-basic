Stack is used for:
- Undo mechanisms
- Balance Parentheses
- Reverse Polish algorithm
- Shunting Yard algorithm
- Reverse Order

Practical:
- Undo operation (generally in editors, drawing app)
- Back (in history) button in browsers
- Maintaining function calls in compiler
- Evaluating mathematical expressions (e.g. Shunting Yard Algorithm)
- Parsing in compilers
- JVM uses stacks to maintain a thread's state in frames
